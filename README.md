# plc-motion-data-collection

Windows forms desktop application developed in vb.net to interface with an Allen Bradley PLC to grab data from a 3 axis motion driving system. This data would then be analysed as part of a preventive maintenance activity or for a debug purpose when the motion is miss-behaving. 
This application is able to grab data such us drive current, velocity, position, torque, from multiple drivers every <than 50ms. This data is then stored in arrays and plotted. It can also be downloaded for external review.
